flaskapp
============================================================
| Creating flask project one by one is very troublesome to ours.
| 'flaskapp' can create a empty flask project directly.
|

.. code:: sh

  $ pip install flaskapp

.. code:: sh

  $ flaskapp create your_project_name
  $ cd your_project_name
  
.. code:: sh
  
  $ python app.py
